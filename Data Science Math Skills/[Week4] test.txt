1. What additional statement, added to the three below, forms a probability distribution?

(1) I missed only my first class today
(2) I missed only my second class today
(3) I missed both my first and second class today

() I missed no classes today
(X) I did not miss my first or second class today
() I missed either my first or my second class today but not both
() I missed all my classes today


2. My friend takes 10 cards at random from a 52-card deck, and places them in a box. 
Then he puts the other 42 cards in a second, identical box. 
He hands me one of the two boxes and asks me to draw out the top card. 
What is the probability that the first card I draw will be the Ace of Spades?

() 1/42
() 1/10
() 1/26
(X) 1/52

=> 
probability of the Ace of Spade is in the First Box = 10/52 
Probability of the Ace of Spade in another box = 42/52
Probability of choosing a box = 1/2

= (1/2)(1/42)(42/52) + (1/2)(1/10)(10/52)
= 1/104 + 1/104
= 1/52

3. I will go sailing today if it does not rain.  Are the following two statements Independent or dependent? 

(1) “I will go sailing today” 
(2) “It will not rain today”

(X) Dependent
() Independent


4. The probability that I will go sailing today AND the fair six-sided die will come up even on the next roll is .3. 
 If these events are independent, what is the probability that I will go sailing today?

() .5
() .3
() .1
(X) .6


=> 
p(A) = I will go sailing today
p(B) = the fair six-sided die will come up even on the next roll

p(AnB) = 0.3
since p(A) and p(B) is independent, p(AnB) = p(A) X p(B)
0.3 = p(A) X 0.5
p(A) = 0.3/0.5 = 0.6


5. I have two coins. One is fair, and has a probability of coming up heads of.5. 
The second is bent, and has a probability of coming up heads of.75. 
If I toss each coin once, what is the probability that at least one of the coins will come up tails?

() 1.0
() 0.375
(X) 0.625
() 0.874

=>
The probability of getting heads on fair coin = 0.5
The probability of getting heads on bent coin = 0.75

we need at least one of the coins will come up tails: p = 1 - p(both are head)

p = 1 - 0.5*0.75
p = 0.625


6. What is the probability, when drawing 5 cards from a fair 52-card deck, of drawing a "full house'' (three of a kind and a pair) in the form AAABB?

() 0.006410256
() 0.1320965
(X) 0.001440576
() 0.000267094

=> 
(choose 1 type of card from 13 kinds of card) X (draw 3 cards from 4 cards) X (choose 1 type of card from 12 kinds of card) X (draw 2 cards from 4 cards) 
/ (draw 5 cards from 52 cards)

= (13C1) X (4C3) X (12C1) X (4C2) / (52C5)


7. If it rains, I do not go sailing. It rains 10% of days;  I go sailing 3% of days.
If it does not rain, what is the (conditional) probability that I go sailing?
Written "p(I go sailing | it does not rain)''?

() 3.000%
() 3.125%
() 3.448%
(X) 3.333%

=> 
3% / 90%


8. I am at my office AND not working 2% of the time.  I am at my office 10% of the time. 
What is the conditional probability that I am not working, if I am at my office?

(X) 20%
() 50%
() 10%
() 1%

=>
(2% X 10%) / ((98% X 10%) + (2% X 10%))


9. The factory quality control department discovers that the conditional probability of making a manufacturing mistake in 
its precision ball bearing production is 4% on Tuesday, 4% on Wednesday, 4% on Thursday, 8% on Monday, and 12% on Friday. 

The Company manufactures an equal amount of ball bearings (20%) on each weekday.  
What is the probability that a defective ball bearing was manufactured on a Friday?

(X) 37.5%
() 20%
() 40%
() 12%

=>
Monday: 8% x 20%(amount of ball bearings)
Tuesday - Thursday: 4% X 20% X 3(3 weekdays)
Friday: 12% X 20%

= Sum(Monday - Friday) / Friday
= 0.024 / 0.064


10. An Urn contains two white marbles and one black marble. 
A marble is drawn from the Urn without replacement and put aside without my seeing it. 
Then a second marble is drawn, and it is white. 
What is the probability that the unknown removed marble is white, and what is the probability that it is black?

(X)  p(the first marble is white |the second marble is white)=.5
	p(the first marble is black | the second marble is white)=.5

()  p(the first marble is white|the second marble is white)=0.6667
	p(the first marble is black|the second marble is white)=0.333

()  p(the first marble is white|the second marble is white)=1.0
	p(the first marble is black|the second marble is white)=0.0

()  p(the first marble is white|the second marble is white)=0.3333
	p(the first marble is black|the second marble is white)=0.6667


=>
p(First white, second white) as p(A) = 2/3 X 1/2 = 1/3
p(first black, second white) as p(B) = 1/3 X 2/2 = 1/3

p(the first marble is white |the second marble is white) = p(A) / (p(A)+p(B)) = 1/2
p(the first marble is black | the second marble is white) = p(B) / (p(A)+p(B)) = 1/2

11. What is the probability, if I flip a fair coin with heads and tails ten times in a row, that I get at least 8 heads?

(X) 0.0547
() 0.1131
() 0.4395
() 0.00977

=> (10C8 + 10C9 + 10C10) X (0.5)^10


12. Suppose I have either a fair coin or a bent coin, and I don’t know which. The bent coin has a 60% probability of coming up heads.
I throw the coin ten times and it comes up heads 8 times. What is the probability I have the fair coin vs. the probability I have the bent coin? 
Assume at the outset there is an equal (.5,.5) prior probability of either coin.

(X) 26.65
() 53.30
() 22.47
() 81.24

=>
p(Fair) = 10C8 X 0.5^10
p(Bent) = 10C8 X 0.6^8 X 0.4^2

p(I have the fair coin vs. the probability I have the bent coin) = p(Fair) / (p(Fair) + p(Bent))
