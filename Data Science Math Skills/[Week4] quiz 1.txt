<Practice quiz on Probability Concepts>

1. If x= "It is raining,'' what is ∼(∼x)?

(X) "It is raining"
() "It is always raining"
() "It is not raining"
() "It is never raining"

2. If the statement “I am 25 years old” is assigned probability 0, what probability is assigned to the statement “I am not 25 years old”?

() Unknown
() −1
(X) 1
() 0

=> p(x)+p(∼x)=1.

3. If I assign to the statement x = "it will rain today'' a probability of p(x)=0.35, what probability must I assign to the statement "it will not rain today?"

() .35
() 0
(X) .65
() .5

4. Is the following collection of statements a probability distribution?
1. I own a Toyota pickup truck
2. I do not own a Toyota pickup truck
3. I own a non-Toyota pickup truck
4. I do not own a non-Toyota pickup truck

(X) No
() Yes

=> The statements are not exclusive: 1 and 4 could both be true, 2 and 3 could both be true, 2 and 4 could both be true, and even 1 and 3
could both be true (if I owned more than one pickup truck). 

5. I don’t know what it means to be “ingenuous.” What probability would I assign to the statement, “I am ingenuous OR I am not ingenuous"?

() 0
(X) 1
() -1
() .5

6. A friend of mine circumscribes a circle inside a square, so
that the diameter of the circle and the edge of the square are the same length.
He asks me to close my eyes and pick a point at random inside the square. He
says the probability that my point will also be inside the circle is Pi/4 
Is this correct?

(X) Yes
() No

=> For a circle with any radius r to be circumscribed inside a square, the square
must have sides each of length 2r. The area of the circle is Pi*r^2 and the
area of the square is (2r)^2 = 4*r^2.
The probability of landing in a circle of area Pi*r^2 when it is known that one is
in the area of the square is equal to the ratio of the area of the circle to
the area of the square in which it is circumscribed, or Pi*r^2/4*r^2 = Pi/4. 

7. The probability of drawing a straight flush (including a Royal Flush) in a five-card poker hand is .0000153908
What is the probability of not drawing a straight flush?

() .9999745688
() .9967253809
() .9996582672
(X) .9999846092

8. What is the probability that a fair, six-sided die will come up with a prime number? 
(Recall that prime numbers are positive integers other than 1 that are divisible only by themselves and 1)

() 1/3
() 1/6
() 2/3
(X) 1/2

=> The faces with 2, 3 and 5 satisfy the condition

9. The joint probability p (the die will come up 5, the next card will be a heart) Is equal to the joint probability:

() p (the next card will not come up 5, the next card will be a heart)
(X) p (the next card will be a heart, the die will come up 5) 
() p (the next card will be a heart, the die will not come up 5)
() p (the die will not come up 5, the next card will not be a heart)
