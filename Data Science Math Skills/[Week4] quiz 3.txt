<Practice quiz on Bayes Theorem and the Binomial Theorem> 

1. A jewelry store that serves just one customer at a time is
concerned about the safety of its isolated customers. 

The store does some research and learns that:
10% of the times that a jewelry store is robbed, a customer is in the store.
A jewelry store has a customer on average 20% of each 24-hour day.
The probability that a jewelry store is being robbed (anywhere in the world) is 1 in 2 million.
What is the probability that a robbery will occur while a customer is in the store?

() 1/500000
() 1/2000000
(X) 1/4000000
() 1/5000000

=> 1/2milion X 0.1 / 0.2

2. If I flip a fair coin, with heads and tails, ten times in a row, what is the probability that I will get exactly six heads?

() 0.021
() 0.187
(X) 0.2051
() 0.305

=> 
10C6 X 0.5^10 = 10!/4!6! X 1/1024 = 0.2051

3. If a coin is bent so that it has a 40% probability of coming up heads, what is the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 throws?

() 0.0974
() 0.1045
(X) 0.1115 
() 0.1219

=> 10C6 X 0.4^6 X 0.6^4

4. A bent coin has 40% probability of coming up heads on each independent toss. 
If I toss the coin ten times, what is the probability that I get at least 8 heads?

() 0.0312
() 0.0213
(X) 0.0123
() 0.0132

=> 10C8 X 0.4^8 X 0.6^2 + 10C9 X 0.4^9 X 0.6^1 + 10C10 X 0.4^8

5. Suppose I have a bent coin with a 60% probability of coming up heads. 
I throw the coin ten times and it comes up heads 8 times.

What is the value of the “likelihood” term in Bayes’ Theorem
-- the conditional probability of the data given the parameter.

(X) 0.120932
() 0.122885
() 0.168835
() 0.043945


=> 
Bayesian “likelihood” = p(observed data | parameter) = 10C8 X 0.6^8 X 0.4^2
 
6. We have the following information about a new medical test for diagnosing cancer.
Before any data are observed, we know that 5% of the population to be tested actually have Cancer. 
Of those tested who do have cancer, 90% of them get an accurate test result of “Positive” for cancer. 
The other 10% get a false test result of “Negative” for Cancer.
Of the people who do not have cancer, 90% of them get an accurate test result of “Negative” for cancer. 
The other 10% get a false test result of “Positive” for cancer.
What is the conditional probability that I have Cancer, if I get a “Positive” test result for Cancer?

() 67.9% 
() 4.5%
() 9.5% 
(X) 32.1% probability that I have cancer


=>
(90%)(5%) / ((90%)(5%) + (10%)(95%) = 32.1%


7. We have the following information about a new medical test for diagnosing cancer. 
Before any data are observed, we know that 8% of the population to be tested actually have Cancer. 
Of those tested who do have cancer, 90% of them get an accurate test result of "Positive'' for cancer. 
The other 10% get a false test result of "Negative'' for Cancer.
Of the people who do not have cancer, 95% of them get an accurate test result of "Negative'' for cancer. 
The other 5% get a false test result of "Positive'' for cancer.
What is the conditional probability that I have cancer, if I get a "Negative'' test result for Cancer?

() 88.2%
(X) 0.9%
() 99.1%
() .80%


=> 
(10%)(8%) / ((10%)(8%)+(95%)(92%)) = 0.9%
 
 
8. An urn contains 50 marbles – 40 blue and 10 white. After 50 draws, exactly 40 blue and 10 white are observed. 
You are not told whether the draw was done “with replacement” or “without replacement.”
What is the probability that the draw was done with replacement?


(X) 12.27%
() 13.98%
() 1
() 87.73% 


9. According to Department of Customs Enforcement Research: 99% of people crossing into the United States are not smugglers.
The majority of all Smugglers at the border (65%) appear nervous and sweaty.
Only 8% of innocent people at the border appear nervous and sweaty. 
If someone at the border appears nervous and sweaty, what is the probability that they are a Smuggler?

() 8.57%
() 7.92%
(X) 7.58%
() 92.42%

=> (65%)(1%) / ((65%)(1%)+(8%)(99%)) = 7.58%
