<Practice quiz on Problem Solving>

1. I am given the following 3 joint probabilities:
p(I am leaving work early, there is a football game that I want to watch this afternoon) = .1
p(I am leaving work early, there is not a football game that I want to watch this afternoon) = .05
p(I am not leaving work early, there is not a football game that I want to watch this afternoon) = .65
What is the probability that there is a football game that I want to watch this afternoon?

() .1
(X) .3
() .2
() .35

2. The Joint probability of my summiting Mt. Baker in the next two years AND publishing a best-selling book in the next two years is .05. If
the probability of my publishing a best-selling book in the next two years is 10%, and the probability of my summiting Mt. Baker in the next two years is 30%, are these two events dependent or independent?

(X) Dependent
() Independent

=> We know this because the joint distribution of 5% does not equal the product distribution of (0.1)×(0.3)=3%. 

3. The Joint probability of my summiting Mt. Baker in the next two years AND my publishing a best-selling book in the next two years is .05. 
If the probability of my publishing a best-selling book in the next two years is 10%, and the probability of my summiting Mt. Baker in the next two years is 30%, what is the probability that (sadly) in the next two years I will neither
summit Mt. Baker nor publish a best-selling book?

(X) .65
() .95
() .25
() .9

=>
Set A = I will summit Mt. Baker in the next two years
Set B = I will publish a best-selling book in the next two years.
(AUB)^c = 1 - (0.3 + 0.1 - 0.05) = 0.65

4. I have two coins. One is fair, and has a probability of coming up heads of .5.
The second is bent, and has a probability of coming up heads of .75. If I toss
each coin once, what is the probability that at least one of the coins will
come up heads?

() .625
(X) .875
() .375
() 1.0

5. What is 11!/9!?

() 110,000
(X) 110
() 554,400
() 4,435,200

6. What is the probability that, in six throws of a die, there
will be exactly one each of “1”, “2”, “3”, “4”, “5” and “6”?

() .00187220 
() .01432110 
(X) .01543210 
() .01176210 

=> 
There are 6!=720 permutations where each face occurs exactly once.
There are 6×6×6×6×6×6=46656 total permutations of 6 throws.
The probability is therefore 720/46656=0.01543210

7. On 1 day in 1000, there is a fire and the fire alarm rings. 
On 1 day in 100, there is no fire and the fire alarm rings (false alarm) 
On 1 day in 10,000, there is a fire and the fire alarm does not ring (defective alarm). 
On 9,889 days out of 10,000, there is no fire and the fire alarm does not ring. 
If the fire alarm rings, what is the (conditional)
probability that there is a fire?
Written p(there is a fire | fire alarm rings)

() 1.12%
(X) 9.09%
() 90.9%
() 1.1%

=>
		 A  | ~A
  F | 10  |   1
~F |100 | 9889
The probability that there is a fire, given that the fire alarm rings, is 10/110=9.09%

8. On 1 day in 1000, there is a fire and the fire alarm rings. 
On 1 day in 100, there is no fire and the fire alarm rings (false alarm) 
On 1 day in 10,000, there is a fire and the fire alarm does not ring (defective alarm). 
On 9,889 days out of 10,000, there is no fire and the fire alarm does not ring. 
If the fire alarm does not ring, what is the (conditional) probability that there is a fire?
p(there is a fire | fire alarm does not ring)

() 1.0001%
() .01000%
() .10011%
(X) 0.01011%

=> 1/9890=0.01011%

9. A group of 45 civil servants at the State Department are newly qualified to serve as Ambassadors to foreign governments. 
There are 22 countries that currently need Ambassadors. 
How many distinct groups of 22 people can the President promote to fill these jobs?

() = 1.06 X (10^35)
() = 8.2334 X (10^12)
() = 2.429 X (10^-13)
(X) = 4.1167 X (10^12)

=> 45!/(23!)(22!)
