<Practice quiz on Types of Functions>

1. Suppose that A={1,2,10} and B={4,8,40}. Which of the following formulae do not define a function f:A→B?

(X) f(1) = 5, f(2) = 8, and f(10) = 40.
() f(1) = 4, f(2) = 40, and f(10) = 8.
() f(a) = 4a, for each a∈A
() f(1) = 4, f(2) = 4, and f(10) = 4.

2. Suppose that A contains every person in the VBS study (see the second video in the course if you're confused here!). Suppose that Y={+,−} and Z={H,S}
Suppose that T:A→Y is the function which gives T(a)=+ if person aa tests positive and T(a)=− if they test negative. 
Suppose that D:A→Z is the function which gives D(a)=H does not actually have VBS and D(a)=S if the person actually has VBS.
Which of the following must be true of person aa if we have a false positive?

() T(a)=− and D(a)=S
() T(a)=− and D(a)=H
() T(a)=+ and D(a)=S
(X) T(a)=+ and D(a)=H

=> False positive is a positive test result (so T(a)=+) which is misleading because the person actually does not have the disease (D(a)=H)

3. Consider the function g:R→R defined by g(x) = x^2 - 1. Which of the following points are not on the graph of g?

() (−1,0)
(X) (2,−1)
() (0,−1)
() (1,0)

4. Let the point A=(2,4). Which of the following graphs does not contain the point A?

() The graph of g(x)=x+2
() The graph of s(x) = x^2
() The graph of f(x)=2x
(X) The graph of h(x)=x−1

5. Suppose that h(x)=−3x+4. Which of the following statements is true?

() h is neither a strictly increasing function nor a strictly decreasing function.
() All statements are correct
() h is a strictly increasing function
(X) h is a strictly decreasing function

=> A function h is called strictly decreasing if whenever a<b, then h(a)>h(b)
The graph of h is a line with negative slope.

6. Suppose that f:R→R is a strictly increasing function, with f(3)=15
Which of the following is a possible value for f(3.7)?

() -3
(X) 17
() 14.7
() 3
