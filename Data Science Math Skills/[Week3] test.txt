() 7^2
() 49^−1
() 7/7^3
(X) 7^−2
 
2. A light-year (the distance light travels in a vacuum in one year) is 9,460 trillion meters. Express in scientific notation.

() 9460×10^12 meters
(X) 9.46×10^15 meters.
() 9.46×10^15 kilometers
() 0.946×10^16 


3. Simplify (x^8)(y^3)(x^-10)(y^-2)

() (x^−80)(y^−6)
(X) (x^−2)(y)
() (x^2)(y)
() (x)(y^−2)

4. Simplify [(x^4)(y^-6)]^(-1)
 
() (x−4)/(y6)
() (x4)/(y−6)
(X) (x^-4)(y^6)
() (x^3)(y^-7)

5. Solve for x:
log_2 (39x) - log_2 (x-5) = 4

() 80/38
() 23/80
(X) −80/23
() 39/23

6. Simplify this expression:
(2^(1/2))^(-3/2)

() x^-1
() x^(4/3)
() x^(1/3)
(X) x^(-3/4)
 
7. Simplify log_10 1000 + log_10 1/10000

(X)−1
()1/10
()1
​()log_10 (-10)

8. If log_3 19=2.680, what is log_9 19

() 0.4347
(X) 1.304
() 0.8934
() 5.216

9. If log_10 b=1.8 and log_a b = 2.5752, what is a?

() 3
(X) 5
() 6
() 4

10. An investment of 1,600 is worth 7,400 after 8.5 years. What is the continuously compounded rate of return of this investment?

() 19.01%
() 20.01
(X) 18.02%
() 17.01%

=> ln(7400/1600)/8.5 = 0.18017

11. A pearl grows in an oyster at a continuously compounded rate of .24 per year. 
If a 25-year old pearl weighs 1 gram, what did it weigh when it began to form?

() 0.02478
(X) 0.002478
() 0.0002478
() 0.2478

=> e^(0.24×25) = 1/x
x = 1/(e0.24×25)
x = 1/403.4288
x = 0.00247875213668434
 
12. log_2 z = 6.754. What is log_10 z?

(X) 2.03316
() 0.49185
() 0.82956
() 1.3508

13. Suppose that g:R→R is a function, and that g(1)=10. 
Suppose that g'(a) is negative for every single value of a. Which of the following could possibly be g(1.5)?

() g(1.5)=11
() g(1.5)=10.1
() g(1.5)=103.4
(X) g(1.5)=9.7

=> Since g'(a) is negative for every single value of a, g is decreasing function.
And therefore we must have g(1.5)<g(1).
