Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","[[1.0000000e+00 3.4217181e-11 1.5637101e-12]\n"," [1.0000000e+00 3.0340397e-09 8.2186299e-11]\n"," [1.0000000e+00 6.5659278e-10 2.3465528e-11]\n"," [1.0000000e+00 9.0501979e-09 1.7843438e-10]\n"," [1.0000000e+00 3.0296647e-11 1.3195968e-12]]\n","   Species_setosa  Species_versicolor  Species_virginica\n","0               1                   0                  0\n","1               1                   0                  0\n","2               1                   0                  0\n","3               1                   0                  0\n","4               1                   0                  0\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
