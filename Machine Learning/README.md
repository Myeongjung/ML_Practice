## Models
| Algorithm | Data format of the result | Types of questions | Does the model is interpretable? | Easy to understand how it works? | Prediction Accuracy | Training Speed | Prediction Speed |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **KNN** | Numerical, Categorical | Regression, Classification | Possible | Yes | Low | Fast | If the number of data is large, it is slow | 
| **Linear regression** | Numerical | Regression | Possible | Yes | Low | Fast | Fast | 
| **Logistic regression** | Categorical | Classification | Quite Possible | Somewhat | Low | Fast | Fast | 
| **Naive Bayes** | Categorical | Classification | Quite Possible | Somewhat | Low | Fast but it's getting slow when the columns are increasing | Fast | 
| **Decision trees** | Numerical, Categorical | Regression, Classification | Quite Possible | Somewhat | Low | Fast | Fast | 
| **Random Forests** | Numerical, Categorical | Regression, Classification | Quite Impossible | No | High | Low | Moderate | 
| **AdaBoost** | Numerical, Categorical | Regression, Classification | Quite Impossible | No | High | Low | Fast | 
| **Neural networks** | Numerical, Categorical | Regression, Classification | Impossible | No | High | Low | Fast |
